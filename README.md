# MATH-3333-Project

This is a project that I did for my Summer 2019 linear algebra class. It is a simple application of linear algebra towards the field of computer science and computer graphics. It allows the user to create a triangle and do a few transformations with it using the power of matrix addition and multiplication from the NumPy library. These transformations include: translation, scaling, and rotation.

LinAlg.py just contains the linear algebra functions involved with the transformations.

TransformApp.py contains the actual program where you can visually see the transformations.

In order to run it for yourself, you will need NumPy and Matplotlib. There is virtually no error checking when it comes to user input, so good luck.

I used the following website for reference: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/2d_transformation.htm.
